                p Hey, I'm Shane! About a year ago, I adopted an 8 year old labradoodle named Yogi from a family that was moving and couldn't take him.
                p I was told he had some separation anxiety, but I was okay with that since at most, I would only have to leave him by himself a day or two a week.
                p.bold Unfortunately, he never wanted to be left alone.
                p After about a month of training, Yogi now he enjoys being home alone (he gets all the pillows to himself).
                p If your dog suffers from separation anxiety, enter your email below and I'll send you my free guide :)

            p Separation anxiety is just as stressful for the owner as it is for the dog. You don't want to be known as the apartment with the dog that just won't stop.
